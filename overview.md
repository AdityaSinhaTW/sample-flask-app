## Overview

This application is intended for use with the `sample-deploy-pipeline` Jenkins application located [here](https://github.com/wilvk/sample-deploy-pipeline).

The application consists of two docker containers:

- A frontend website written in Python Flask
- A backend database using PostgreSQL

It is a simple message-posting application where messages entered by the user in the web interface are written to the PostgreSQL database. The web front-end shows all messages entered by users.
